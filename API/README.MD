The virtual environment used in this project is managed with pip, so, in order to be able to contribute, pipenv must be installed in your device, if you haven't installed pipenv yet, you can do so by using the following  install command in your terminal or command prompt shell:

### If Python is managed by pip

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

### If Python is managed by brew

```bash
brew install pipenv
```

### Initiating the venv

Now that pipenv is installed, you are ready to start the venv, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install
```

This will install the dependencies inside the pipfile as well as creating a virtual environment, select the venv as an interpreter, if you don't see it as an option, you can send in the path given by pipenv for the venv into vscode, now that the venv is selected as our interpreter, start it with the following command:

```bash
pipenv shell
```
